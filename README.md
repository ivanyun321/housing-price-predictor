# Housing Price Predictor
In this project, I aim to create multiple models for housing price prediction using a dataset from Cook County, Illinois. I will be starting with a more simple linear regression model,
before attempting a random forest model, and finally a neural net. 

## Important Background Information
Cook County, Illinois has been redlined historically, and some of the house price estimates still reflect that. Within our model, we will be doing our best to not include such biases within our predictions.

For those that want to test the model, it will be hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and deployed as a webpage.
