# Housing Price Predictor
In this project, I aim to create multiple models for housing price prediction using a dataset from Cook County, Illinois. I will be starting with a more simple linear regression model,
before attempting a random forest model, and finally a neural net. For those that want to test the model, it will be hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and deployed as a webpage.
